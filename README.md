# Luxe & Co. Salon Landing Page

Developed a modern, responsive landing page for Luxe & Co., a luxury salon offering hair, nail, skincare, and spa services. The project focuses on showcasing services, building brand trust, and driving online bookings through a clean UI and strategic content layout.

Built using React for dynamic components and Tailwind CSS for fast, utility-first styling, ensuring a sleek, mobile-friendly user experience.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
